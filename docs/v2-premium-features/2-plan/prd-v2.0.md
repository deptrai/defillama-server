- **When**: Whale wallet moves $1.5M USDC
- **Then**: Alert triggered within 5 seconds, notification sent

**TC-002**: Custom threshold
- **Given**: User sets $500K threshold for whale wallet
- **When**: Whale wallet moves $400K (below threshold)
- **Then**: No alert triggered

**TC-003**: Multi-channel notification
- **Given**: User enables Telegram + Email notifications
- **When**: Whale alert triggered
- **Then**: Notifications sent to both Telegram and Email within 5 seconds

- **Then**: All 50 alerts displayed with correct details

**Success Metrics**:
- 10K+ whale alerts created by users
- 95%+ alert delivery success rate
- <5 second alert latency (p95)
- 80%+ user engagement (weekly active)

**Risks & Mitigation**:
