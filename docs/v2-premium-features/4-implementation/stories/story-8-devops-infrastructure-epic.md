## Technical Architecture

### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

```typescript
// migrations/1234567890-CreateUsersTable.ts
import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from "typeorm";

export class CreateUsersTable1234567890 implements MigrationInterface {
  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(`
      CREATE TABLE users (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
      );
    `);
  }

  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE users;`);
  }
}
```

### Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK)

```typescript
// infrastructure/stack.ts
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as ecs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs';
import * as rds from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-rds';

export class InfrastructureStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // ECS Cluster
    const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, 'Cluster', {
      vpc: this.vpc,
    });

    // RDS Database
    const database = new rds.DatabaseInstance(this, 'Database', {
      engine: rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres({ version: rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_15 }),
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.T3, ec2.InstanceSize.MEDIUM),
      vpc: this.vpc,
    });
  }
}
```

### Monitoring & Alerting (Datadog)

```typescript
// monitoring/datadog.ts
import { datadogLogs } from '@datadog/browser-logs';
import { datadogRum } from '@datadog/browser-rum';

// Initialize Datadog
datadogLogs.init({
  clientToken: process.env.DD_CLIENT_TOKEN,
  site: 'datadoghq.com',
  forwardErrorsToLogs: true,
  sampleRate: 100,
});

datadogRum.init({
  applicationId: process.env.DD_APPLICATION_ID,
  clientToken: process.env.DD_CLIENT_TOKEN,
  site: 'datadoghq.com',
  service: 'defillama-premium',
  env: process.env.NODE_ENV,

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**:
- CI/CD pipeline reliability (>95% deployment success rate) - Mitigation: Automated testing, rollback mechanisms, blue-green/canary deployments
- Database backup & restore (<1 hour restore time) - Mitigation: Automated daily backups, monthly restore tests, documented runbooks
- Infrastructure uptime (>99.9% uptime) - Mitigation: Multi-AZ deployment, auto-scaling, health checks, monitoring

**Medium Risk**:
- Database migration failures - Mitigation: Up/down migrations, testing before deployment, rollback support
- Infrastructure cost variance (<10% monthly) - Mitigation: AWS Cost Explorer, budget alerts, resource optimization
- Alert accuracy (>95% no false positives) - Mitigation: Alert tuning, anomaly detection, alert review

**Low Risk**:
- Build time (<10 minutes) - Mitigation: Caching, parallel builds, optimized dependencies
- Deployment time (<5 minutes) - Mitigation: Blue-green deployment, pre-warmed containers
- Incident response time (<15 minutes) - Mitigation: PagerDuty, on-call rotation, runbooks
