      name: "Warm up"
    - duration: 120
      arrivalRate: 50
      name: "Sustained load"

  - name: "Create Alert"
    flow:

          json:
            name: "Load Test Alert"
            type: "whale"
            conditions:
              chain: "ethereum"
              token: "USDT"
              threshold_usd: 1000000
            actions:
              channels: ["email"]
```

**k6** (Alternative)
```javascript
// tests/load/alerts.k6.js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '1m', target: 10 },
    { duration: '2m', target: 50 },
    { duration: '1m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '1m', target: 0 },
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],
  },
};

export default function () {
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Load Test Alert',
    type: 'whale',
    conditions: {
      chain: 'ethereum',
      token: 'USDT',
      threshold_usd: 1000000,
    },
    actions: {
      channels: ['email'],
    },
  });

  const params = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer test-token',
    },
  };

  const res = http.post('http://localhost:3000/v2/premium/alerts/whale', payload, params);
  
  check(res, {
    'status is 201': (r) => r.status === 201,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
  });

  sleep(1);
}
```

## üîç Test Cases

### TC1: Concurrent Alert Creation
```
Given: 100 concurrent users
When: Each user creates 10 whale alerts
Then: 
  - All 1,000 alerts created successfully
  - Response time p95 < 500ms
  - Error rate < 1%
  - No database deadlocks
```

### TC2: Concurrent Alert Retrieval
```
Given: 500 concurrent users
When: Each user retrieves alert list 20 times
Then:
  - All 10,000 requests successful
  - Response time p95 < 200ms
  - Database query time < 100ms
  - No connection pool exhaustion
```

### TC3: Rate Limiting
```
Given: 1 user making rapid requests
When: User makes 150 requests in 1 minute
Then:
  - First 100 requests succeed (200/201)
  - Next 50 requests fail (429)
  - Rate limit headers present
  - Rate limit resets after 1 minute
```

### TC4: Database Connection Pool
```
Given: 200 concurrent users
When: All users query database simultaneously
Then:
  - Connection pool size stays < 50
  - No "too many connections" errors
  - Connections released properly
  - No connection leaks
```

### TC5: Memory Leak Test
```
Given: 50 concurrent users
When: System runs for 30 minutes
Then:
  - Memory usage stable (< 2GB)
  - No memory leaks detected
  - Garbage collection working
  - No performance degradation
```
