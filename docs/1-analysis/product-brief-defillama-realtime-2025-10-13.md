## üéØ Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points
**For DeFi Researchers:**
- Manual data refresh required every few minutes
- Missing critical protocol events and market movements
- No proactive alerts for significant changes
- Delayed reaction to market opportunities

**For Active Traders:**
- Static API calls insufficient for trading decisions
- No real-time price movement notifications
- Missing arbitrage opportunities due to data lag
- Manual monitoring of multiple protocols required

**For Protocol Teams:**
- No real-time monitoring of their own protocol metrics
- Delayed awareness of TVL changes or issues
- Manual tracking of competitive landscape
- No automated alerting for critical thresholds

### Quantified Impact
- **Time Lost**: Users spend 30-40% of their time manually refreshing data
- **Missed Opportunities**: Traders report missing 15-20% of arbitrage opportunities
- **Delayed Response**: Protocol teams react 2-4 hours late to critical changes
- **User Churn**: 25% of power users request real-time features before considering alternatives

### Market Urgency
- Competitors (DeBank, Zapper) launching real-time features
- Institutional adoption requires real-time data feeds
- DeFi market volatility demands instant information
- User expectations shifting toward real-time experiences
