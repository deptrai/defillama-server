## EPIC-6: Advanced Analytics & AI (CRITICAL ISSUES)

### Issue #1: üö® CRITICAL - User Stories Features Completely Different from PRD

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: User Stories implement wrong features!

**User Stories v2.0** has:
- Feature 6.1: AI Price Predictions (34 points) - Price prediction ML model
- Feature 6.2: Custom Dashboards (33 points) - Dashboard widgets
- Feature 6.3: (need to verify)

**PRD v2.0** requires:
- F-023: Backtesting Engine (34 points, 6 weeks) - Historical data backtesting, strategy builder
- F-024: AI Market Insights Beta (34 points, 8 weeks) - On-chain analysis, social sentiment, market trends
- F-025: Custom Dashboard Builder (32 points, 6 weeks) - Drag-and-drop dashboard builder

**Root Cause**: User Stories were written based on different requirements (price predictions) instead of PRD requirements (backtesting, market insights, dashboards)

**Recommendation**: **REWRITE ALL EPIC-6 USER STORIES** to match PRD features F-023 to F-025

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Task**: Create EPIC-7: Cross-EPIC Integration user stories (5 stories, 25 points)

**Scope**: Integration stories across EPICs (e.g., alerts + portfolio, tax + portfolio, etc.)

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

---

### Priority 3: Create EPIC-8 User Stories (CRITICAL)

## Total Estimated Effort

**Total**: 8-13 hours

**Breakdown**:
- EPIC-6 User Stories: 2-3 hours
- EPIC-7 User Stories: 1-2 hours
- EPIC-8 User Stories: 2-3 hours
- EPIC-9 User Stories: 1-2 hours
- EPIC-6 Tech Spec: 1-2 hours

---

## Recommendation

**Option 1**: Fix ALL issues (8-13 hours)
- Rewrite EPIC-6 User Stories
- Create EPIC-7, EPIC-8, EPIC-9 User Stories
- Update EPIC-6 Tech Spec

**Option 2**: Fix EPIC-6 only (3-5 hours)
- Rewrite EPIC-6 User Stories
- Update EPIC-6 Tech Spec
- Leave EPIC-7, EPIC-8, EPIC-9 for later (they're enabler EPICs, lower priority)

**Option 3**: Skip enabler EPICs (3-5 hours)
- Rewrite EPIC-6 User Stories
- Update EPIC-6 Tech Spec
- Remove EPIC-7, EPIC-8, EPIC-9 from summary table (they're not in PRD)

---

**Recommended Approach**: **Option 3** (Skip enabler EPICs)

**Rationale**:
- EPIC-7, EPIC-8, EPIC-9 are not defined in PRD
- They're enabler EPICs (cross-cutting concerns)
- Focus on feature EPICs (EPIC-1 to EPIC-6) first
- Can add enabler EPICs later if needed
