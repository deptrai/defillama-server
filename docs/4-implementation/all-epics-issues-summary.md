## EPIC-6: Advanced Analytics & AI (CRITICAL ISSUES)

### Issue #1: üö® CRITICAL - User Stories Features Completely Different from PRD

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: User Stories implement wrong features!

**User Stories v2.0** has:
- Feature 6.1: AI Price Predictions (34 points) - Price prediction ML model
- Feature 6.2: Custom Dashboards (33 points) - Dashboard widgets
- Feature 6.3: (need to verify)

**PRD v2.0** requires:
- F-023: Backtesting Engine (34 points, 6 weeks) - Historical data backtesting, strategy builder
- F-024: AI Market Insights Beta (34 points, 8 weeks) - On-chain analysis, social sentiment, market trends
- F-025: Custom Dashboard Builder (32 points, 6 weeks) - Drag-and-drop dashboard builder
