# Story 1.5: Infrastructure and Deployment

Status: Draft

## Story

As a **DevOps engineer and development team member**,
I want **to deploy and manage the real-time analytics infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code**,
so that **the system is scalable, maintainable, and follows best practices for production deployment**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Infrastructure as Code (CDK)**
   - Complete CDK stack for all real-time analytics components
   - Redis ElastiCache cluster with encryption and high availability
   - API Gateway v2 with WebSocket support and custom domain
   - Lambda functions with proper IAM roles and environment variables
   - SQS/SNS queues with dead letter queues and monitoring

2. **Security Configuration**
   - TLS 1.3 encryption for all WebSocket connections
   - IAM roles with least privilege access
   - VPC configuration with private subnets for databases
   - API key management and rotation policies
   - Security groups with minimal required access

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - CloudWatch dashboards for all components
   - Custom metrics for business logic (connections, events, alerts)
   - Distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray
   - Operational alerts for system health and performance
   - Log aggregation with structured logging

4. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Automated CI/CD pipeline with staging and production environments
   - Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
   - Automated testing in deployment pipeline
   - Rollback capabilities for failed deployments
   - Environment-specific configuration management

5. **Operational Excellence**
   - Auto-scaling configuration for Lambda functions
   - Backup and disaster recovery procedures
   - Performance tuning and optimization
   - Cost optimization and monitoring
   - Documentation for operational procedures

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK with TypeScript for consistency
- **Security First**: Encryption, least privilege, and network isolation
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing
- **Automation**: Fully automated deployment and rollback capabilities

### Source Tree Components to Touch

- `infrastructure/` - CDK stack definitions and configurations
- `infrastructure/stacks/realtime-analytics-stack.ts` - Main infrastructure stack
- `infrastructure/constructs/` - Reusable CDK constructs
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions
- `scripts/` - Deployment and operational scripts
- `docs/operations/` - Operational documentation and runbooks

### Testing Standards Summary

- **Infrastructure Testing**: CDK unit tests and integration tests
- **Security Testing**: Automated security scanning in pipeline
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing of deployed infrastructure
- **Disaster Recovery**: Regular DR testing and validation

### Project Structure Notes

- Infrastructure follows existing CDK patterns and conventions
- Security configuration aligns with existing security policies
- Monitoring extends existing CloudWatch setup
- CI/CD pipeline follows existing deployment patterns
