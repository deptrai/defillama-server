# Story 1.3: Alert Engine and Notification System

Status: Draft

## Story

As a **DeFi researcher, trader, or protocol team member**,
I want **to create custom alert rules and receive notifications when specific conditions are met**,
so that **I can respond immediately to important market events and protocol changes without constant monitoring**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Alert Rule Management**
   - Users can create, update, and delete alert rules via REST API
   - Rules support multiple condition types (TVL thresholds, price changes, protocol events)
   - Rules include user preferences for notification channels
   - Rule validation prevents invalid or conflicting conditions

2. **Rule Evaluation Engine**
   - Real-time evaluation of rules against incoming events
   - Support for complex conditions with AND/OR logic
   - Threshold-based alerts (absolute values and percentage changes)
   - Rule evaluation completes within 100ms of event receipt

3. **Notification Delivery**
   - Multi-channel delivery: email, webhook, mobile push notifications
   - Notification templates with event-specific data
   - Delivery confirmation and failure tracking
   - Notification delivery within 30 seconds of rule trigger

4. **Alert Throttling and Deduplication**
   - Configurable throttling to prevent spam (default: 5 minutes)
   - Deduplication of similar alerts within time windows
   - User-configurable alert frequency preferences
   - Alert history tracking for audit purposes

5. **Performance and Reliability**
   - Process 100+ rule evaluations per second
   - Support 10,000+ active alert rules
   - Graceful handling of notification service failures
   - Alert processing latency <2 seconds end-to-end

  - [ ] Integration tests for notification delivery
  - [ ] Load testing with 10,000+ active rules
  - [ ] End-to-end testing of alert workflows
  - [ ] Performance testing for evaluation latency

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

- **Rule-based Engine**: Flexible condition evaluation with boolean logic
- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Amazon SES for email, SNS for mobile, HTTP for webhooks
- **Throttling Strategy**: Redis-based throttling to prevent notification spam
- **Event-driven Processing**: SQS integration with event processor

### Source Tree Components to Touch

- `src/alerts/` - New directory for alert system components
- `src/alerts/rule-engine.ts` - Rule evaluation logic
- `src/alerts/notification-service.ts` - Multi-channel notification delivery
- `src/alerts/throttling-manager.ts` - Alert throttling and deduplication
- `src/api/alerts/` - REST API endpoints for rule management
- `database/schema/` - Alert rules and history tables
- `infrastructure/` - CDK updates for SES, SNS, and SQS

### Testing Standards Summary

- **Unit Testing**: Jest with 90% coverage for rule evaluation and notification logic
- **Integration Testing**: SES email delivery, webhook calls, database operations
- **Load Testing**: Artillery.io for high-volume rule evaluation
- **End-to-end Testing**: Complete alert workflow from rule creation to delivery

### Project Structure Notes

- Alert system follows existing API patterns for rule management
- Notification service integrates with existing AWS services
- Database schema extends existing user and configuration tables
- Monitoring integrates with existing CloudWatch setup
