# Story 1.1: WebSocket Connection Manager Foundation

Status: Draft

## Story

As a **DeFi researcher, trader, or protocol team member**,
I want **to establish real-time WebSocket connections to DeFiLlama's analytics platform**,
so that **I can receive live data updates without manual refresh cycles and build real-time applications**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **WebSocket Connection Establishment**
   - WebSocket endpoint available at `wss://api.llama.fi/v2/realtime`
   - Connections authenticate using API key in auth object
   - Invalid API keys are rejected with clear error messages
   - Connection establishment completes within 2 seconds

2. **Connection Lifecycle Management**
   - Graceful handling of connection failures and reconnections
   - Automatic cleanup of disconnected clients
   - Connection state persistence in Redis for scalability
   - Support for connection heartbeat/ping-pong mechanism

3. **Room-based Subscription System**
   - Clients can subscribe to protocol-specific rooms (e.g., "uniswap-v3:ethereum")
   - Clients can subscribe to event-type rooms (e.g., "tvl_changes")
   - Subscription management with subscribe/unsubscribe events
   - Room membership tracked in Redis for message routing

4. **Message Routing Infrastructure**
   - Messages routed only to subscribed clients in relevant rooms
   - Support for broadcast messages to all connected clients
   - Message queuing for temporarily disconnected clients
   - Error handling for failed message delivery

5. **Performance and Scalability**
   - Support for 10,000+ concurrent connections (Phase 1 target)
   - Connection establishment latency <100ms (p95)
   - Message routing latency <50ms (p95)
   - Redis-based state management for horizontal scaling

- [ ] **Task 4: Message Routing System** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement message routing to subscribed clients
  - [ ] Create broadcast messaging capability
  - [ ] Add message queuing for offline clients
  - [ ] Implement delivery confirmation tracking

  - [ ] Load testing with 1,000+ concurrent connections
  - [ ] End-to-end testing of subscription workflows
  - [ ] Performance testing for latency requirements

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

- **Event-driven Architecture**: Leverage existing Lambda-based event processing
- **Serverless Pattern**: Use AWS Lambda for WebSocket handlers to maintain consistency
- **Redis Caching**: Use Redis ElastiCache for connection state and room management
- **API Gateway v2**: Required for WebSocket support in AWS serverless architecture

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**Implementation Location: `defi/` Service**

- `defi/src/websocket/` - New directory for WebSocket-related components
- `defi/src/websocket/handlers/connection.ts` - Connection lifecycle handlers
- `defi/src/websocket/handlers/message.ts` - Message routing handlers
- `defi/src/websocket/services/ConnectionManager.ts` - Connection state management
- `defi/src/websocket/services/RoomManager.ts` - Room subscription management
- `defi/src/websocket/services/MessageRouter.ts` - Message routing logic
- `defi/src/websocket/utils/redis.ts` - Redis client configuration
- `defi/resources/websocket-api.yml` - API Gateway v2 WebSocket configuration
- `defi/resources/redis-cluster.yml` - Redis ElastiCache configuration
- `defi/serverless.yml` - Add WebSocket Lambda functions

### Testing Standards Summary

- **Unit Testing**: Jest with 90% coverage target
- **Integration Testing**: Redis operations, WebSocket lifecycle
- **Load Testing**: Artillery.io for concurrent connection testing
- **Security Testing**: API key validation, connection abuse prevention

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with existing serverless microservices architecture
- New WebSocket components follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Redis integration follows existing database connection patterns
- CDK infrastructure updates maintain existing deployment patterns
