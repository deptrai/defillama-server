# Story 1.4: Advanced Query Processor

Status: Draft

## Story

As a **DeFi researcher, trader, or protocol team member**,
I want **to execute complex, real-time queries with multiple filters and aggregations**,
so that **I can perform sophisticated analysis and build custom applications with precise data requirements**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Complex Query Support**
   - Support multiple filter types: protocols, chains, TVL ranges, time ranges
   - Boolean logic for combining filters (AND, OR, NOT operations)
   - Nested filter conditions with proper precedence
   - Query validation and error handling for malformed requests

2. **Real-time Aggregations**
   - Sum, average, min, max aggregations across filtered data
   - Group-by operations for chains, protocols, time periods
   - Percentile calculations for statistical analysis
   - Real-time aggregation results updated with live data

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Query response time <500ms (p95) for complex queries
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed query results
   - Query result pagination for large datasets
   - Intelligent cache invalidation on data updates

4. **API Design and Documentation**
   - RESTful API with clear request/response schemas
   - Comprehensive API documentation with examples
   - Rate limiting per API key tier (100-10,000 requests/minute)
   - Error responses with actionable error messages

5. **Scalability and Reliability**
   - Support 1,000+ concurrent query requests
   - Graceful degradation when cache or database unavailable
   - Query timeout protection (30 seconds maximum)
   - Comprehensive monitoring and performance metrics

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

- **Query Processing**: Efficient parsing and execution of complex filter expressions
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis-based caching with intelligent invalidation
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following existing API patterns
- **Performance**: Sub-500ms response times with horizontal scaling support

### Source Tree Components to Touch

- `src/query/` - New directory for advanced query components
- `src/query/query-processor.ts` - Main query processing logic
- `src/query/aggregation-engine.ts` - Aggregation and group-by operations
- `src/query/cache-manager.ts` - Query result caching
- `src/api/query/` - REST API endpoints for advanced queries
- `src/middleware/` - Rate limiting and authentication middleware
- `infrastructure/` - CDK updates for API Gateway and Lambda

### Testing Standards Summary

- **Unit Testing**: Jest with 90% coverage for query processing logic
- **Integration Testing**: Redis cache operations, database queries
- **Load Testing**: Artillery.io for concurrent query performance
- **Performance Testing**: Response time measurement under various loads

### Project Structure Notes

- Query processor follows existing API service patterns
- Cache management extends existing Redis infrastructure
- API endpoints follow existing authentication and rate limiting patterns
- Monitoring integrates with existing CloudWatch metrics
