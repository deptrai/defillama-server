2. **JSONB Evidence Storage**: Flexible storage for different evidence types
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Consistent algorithm across all detectors
4. **Mock Implementations**: Clear TODO markers for future integration

### Database Decisions
1. **Single Table**: `suspicious_activities` for all activity types
2. **JSONB Field**: Flexible evidence storage
3. **6 Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
4. **Status Workflow**: investigating → confirmed/false_positive → resolved

### API Decisions

2. **Filtering**: Comprehensive query parameters
3. **Pagination**: Limit/offset pagination
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Evidence Storage
**Problem**: Different activity types have different evidence structures  
**Solution**: Used JSONB field for flexible evidence storage while maintaining structured fields for common attributes

### Challenge 2: Confidence Scoring
**Problem**: Need consistent confidence scoring across different detection types  
**Solution**: Implemented base confidence + adjustments pattern for all detectors

### Challenge 3: Alert Fatigue
**Problem**: Too many alerts can overwhelm users  
**Solution**: Implemented deduplication (1-hour window) and configurable thresholds

### Challenge 4: Mock Implementations
**Problem**: Need to indicate which methods are mock implementations  
**Solution**: Added detailed JSDoc comments with NOTE sections and TODO markers

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term (1-3 months)
1. Integrate with real blockchain data sources (Etherscan, etc.)
2. Implement email/webhook/push notification services
3. Add dashboard for monitoring suspicious activities
4. Add automated response actions

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
1. Add machine learning models for improved detection
2. Add historical analysis and trend detection
3. Add cross-chain correlation analysis
4. Add reputation scoring for wallets/protocols

### Long-term (6-12 months)
1. Add predictive analytics
2. Add automated investigation workflows
3. Add integration with law enforcement reporting
4. Add community reporting and verification

## Lessons Learned
