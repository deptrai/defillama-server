## 6. Dependencies Analysis

### 6.1 External Dependencies

| Story | External Dependency | Status | Criticality |
|-------|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| 2.1.1 | Blockchain indexers (The Graph, custom) | ✅ Available | CRITICAL |
| 2.1.2 | IRS tax rules database | ✅ Available | CRITICAL |
| 2.1.3 | IRS Publication 550 (wash sale rules) | ✅ Available | CRITICAL |
| 2.1.4 | IRS form templates (8949, Schedule D) | ✅ Available | CRITICAL |
| 2.1.5 | Multi-chain RPC providers | ✅ Available | CRITICAL |
| 2.1.6 | Tax jurisdiction databases (US, UK, EU, AU) | ✅ Available | HIGH |
| 2.1.9 | CPA validation partners | ⚠️ Need to secure | HIGH |

**Action Required**: Secure CPA validation partners before Sprint 5

### 6.2 Internal Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Status | Criticality |
|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2.1.2 | 2.1.1 (Transaction import) | ✅ Documented | CRITICAL |
| 2.1.3 | 2.1.2 (Cost basis) | ✅ Documented | CRITICAL |
| 2.1.4 | 2.1.3 (Gains/losses) | ✅ Documented | CRITICAL |
| 2.1.5 | 2.1.1 (Transaction import) | ✅ Documented | HIGH |
| 2.1.7 | 2.1.4 (Form generation) | ✅ Documented | MEDIUM |
| 2.1.8 | 2.1.2, 2.1.3 (Calculations) | ✅ Documented | MEDIUM |
| 2.1.9 | 2.1.2, 2.1.3 (Calculations) | ✅ Documented | LOW |

**All internal dependencies are well documented** ✅

### 6.3 Cross-EPIC Dependencies

| EPIC-2 Story | Depends On | Status |
|--------------|------------|--------|
| 2.1.1 | F-007 (Multi-Wallet Portfolio Tracker) | ⚠️ MEDIUM dependency |

**Note**: PRD states F-004 depends on F-007, but EPIC v2.0 marks this as MEDIUM dependency. EPIC-2 can work standalone by directly importing wallet transactions without portfolio integration.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with EPIC-2 independently, integrate with Portfolio later in EPIC-7 (Cross-EPIC Integration).
