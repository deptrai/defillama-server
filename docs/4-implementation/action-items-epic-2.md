## 1. Critical Action Item

### 1.1 Secure CPA Validation Partner

**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Deadline**: Before Sprint 5 (Q4 2025)  
**Owner**: Luis (Product Owner)  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT STARTED

**Description**:
EPIC-2 (Tax & Compliance) requires CPA validation to ensure 99%+ tax calculation accuracy. We need to secure a CPA validation partner before Sprint 5 to validate:
- Tax calculation algorithms (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO, Specific ID)
- IRS form generation (Form 8949, Schedule D)
- Multi-jurisdiction tax rules (US, UK, EU, AU)
- Wash sale rules (IRS Publication 550)

**Why Critical**:
- Tax calculation errors can lead to IRS penalties for users
- 99%+ accuracy requirement cannot be met without CPA validation
- Tax season deadline (April 2026) is non-negotiable
- Legal liability and insurance requirements

**Options**:

#### Option 1: Partner with Existing Tax Software (RECOMMENDED)
**Partners**: CoinTracker, Koinly, TaxBit  
**Pros**:
- Established tax calculation engines
- Already CPA-validated
- Multi-jurisdiction support
- API integration available
- Lower risk

**Cons**:
- Revenue sharing (10-20%)
- Less control over calculations
- Dependency on external service

**Cost**: $50K-100K/year + revenue share  
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks to integrate

#### Option 2: Hire In-House Tax Expert
**Role**: Senior Tax Accountant (CPA)  
**Pros**:
- Full control over calculations
- Custom tax optimization
- No revenue sharing
- Long-term asset

**Cons**:
- Higher upfront cost
- Longer timeline
- Need to build validation process
- Higher risk

**Cost**: $120K-150K/year salary + benefits  
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks to hire + onboard

#### Option 3: Engage External CPA Firm
**Firms**: Big 4 (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) or specialized crypto tax firms  
**Pros**:
- Expert validation
- Legal protection
- Credibility
- Flexible engagement

**Cons**:
- Expensive
- Slower process
- May not understand DeFi complexity

**Cost**: $200K-500K for validation project  
**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks

**Recommendation**: **Option 1 (Partner with CoinTracker/Koinly)**
- Fastest time to market (2-4 weeks)
- Lowest risk (already validated)
- Reasonable cost ($50K-100K/year)
- Can switch to Option 2 later if needed
