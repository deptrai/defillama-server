## ⚠️ REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED

### Technical Lead Review (9.8/10) + Scrum Master Review (8.5/10)

**Critical Issue Identified**: Q4 2025 velocity (46.7 points/sprint) was too high for new team

**Recommendations Implemented**:

1. ✅ **Velocity Adjustment** (CRITICAL)
   - **Original**: Q4 2025 = 46.7 points/sprint (280 points total)
   - **Updated**: Q4 2025 = 35.0 points/sprint (210 points total)
   - **Rationale**: New teams typically start at 20-30 points/sprint
   - **Impact**: 70 points moved to Q1 2026

2. ✅ **Ramp-Up Plan** (CRITICAL)
   - Sprint 1-2: 30 points/sprint (ramp-up, team onboarding)
   - Sprint 3-4: 35 points/sprint (stabilization)
   - Sprint 5-6: 40 points/sprint (full velocity)
   - **Rationale**: Gradual velocity increase reduces burnout risk

3. ⏳ **Change Control Process** (MEDIUM) - To be implemented
   - Product Owner approval for scope changes
   - Impact assessment (story points, timeline, budget)
   - Change log maintained

4. ⏳ **Spike Stories** (MEDIUM) - To be added
   - 5% spike stories per sprint
   - Research new technologies, POC, technical feasibility

5. ⏳ **Load Testing** (MEDIUM) - To be added
   - Sprint 3: Initial load testing
   - Sprint 6: Full load testing

6. ⏳ **Security Audit** (MEDIUM) - To be added
   - Sprint 6: Security audit

7. ⏳ **Team Building** (LOW) - To be scheduled
   - Monthly team building activities

**Overall Impact**:
- ✅ Timeline unchanged (14 months)
- ✅ Total story points unchanged (760 points)
- ✅ Reduced burnout risk
- ✅ More realistic velocity
- ✅ Better team morale

### Sprint Velocity

**⚠️ UPDATED AFTER REVIEWS** (Technical Lead + Scrum Master recommendations)

| Quarter | Sprints | Team Size | Velocity (points/sprint) | Total Points | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------------------------|--------------|-------|
| Q4 2025 | 6 | 6 engineers | 35.0 (adjusted) | 210 | ⚠️ Reduced from 46.7 (ramp-up phase) |
| Q1 2026 | 6 | 5.5 engineers | 38.3 (adjusted) | 230 | ⚠️ Increased from 26.7 (absorbs Q4 delay) |
| Q2 2026 | 6 | 5 engineers | 23.3 | 140 | ✅ No change |
| Q3 2026 | 6 | 5 engineers | 30.0 | 180 | ✅ No change |
| **Total** | **28** | **5-6** | **27.1 avg** | **760** | ✅ Total unchanged |

**Velocity Ramp-Up Plan** (Q4 2025):
- Sprint 1-2: 30 points/sprint (ramp-up, team onboarding)
- Sprint 3-4: 35 points/sprint (stabilization)
- Sprint 5-6: 40 points/sprint (full velocity)

**Rationale**: New teams typically start at 20-30 points/sprint. Original 46.7 points/sprint was too aggressive and risked burnout.

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION

### High-Priority Risks

**Risk 1**: Team velocity lower than planned (46.7 points/sprint Q4)
- **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Impact**: HIGH
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with conservative velocity (40 points/sprint)
  - Adjust after Sprint 2 based on actual velocity
  - Add buffer sprints (Sprints 25-28)

**Risk 2**: Holiday season impact (Sprint 6: Dec 29 - Jan 11)
- **Probability**: HIGH
- **Impact**: MEDIUM
- **Mitigation**:
  - Plan for 20% reduced velocity
  - Move critical stories to Sprint 5
  - Allow flexible time off

**Risk 3**: Tax calculation complexity (Sprints 4-6)
- **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Impact**: CRITICAL
- **Mitigation**:
  - Hire external tax expert
  - CPA validation
  - Extensive testing (10,000+ test cases)

**Risk 4**: Multi-chain integration complexity (all sprints)
- **Probability**: HIGH
- **Impact**: HIGH
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use existing DeFiLlama data sources
  - Implement fallback mechanisms
  - Start with top 10 chains, expand gradually
