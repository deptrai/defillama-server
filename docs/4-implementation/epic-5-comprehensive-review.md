## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Review Scope

This comprehensive review covers **ALL** documentation for EPIC-5:
1. ‚úÖ **PRD v2.0**: Section 4.4.1-4.4.4 (Q3 2026: Security features F-019 to F-022)
2. ‚úÖ **EPIC v2.0**: Section 7 (EPIC-5: Security & Risk Management)
3. ‚úÖ **User Stories v2.0**: EPIC-5 stories (Story 5.1.1 - 5.4.x)
4. ‚úÖ **Technical Architecture v2.0**: EPIC-5 architecture sections
5. ‚úÖ **Tech Spec EPIC-5**: Security & Risk Management technical specifications

### 1.2 Initial Findings (Quick Scan)

**PRD Features** (Section 4.4):
- F-019: Transaction Security Scanner (5 weeks)
- F-020: Smart Contract Risk Scoring (4 weeks)
- F-021: Wallet Security Checker (3 weeks)
- F-022: Protocol Health Monitor (4 weeks)
- **Total**: 4 features, 16 weeks

**EPIC v2.0** (Section 7):
- F-019: Transaction Security Scanner (34 points, 5 weeks)
- F-020: Smart Contract Risk Scoring (21 points, 4 weeks)
- F-021: Wallet Security Checker (13 points, 3 weeks)
- F-022: Protocol Health Monitor (12 points, 4 weeks)
- **Total**: 4 features, 80 points, 16 weeks

**User Stories v2.0**:

## 2. Detailed Analysis (COMPLETED)

### 2.1 PRD vs EPIC vs User Stories Consistency

**PRD Section 4.4** (Q3 2026: Security & Advanced):
- F-019: Transaction Security Scanner (5 weeks, P0)
- F-020: Smart Contract Risk Scoring (4 weeks, P0)
- F-021: Wallet Security Checker (3 weeks, P1)
- F-022: Protocol Health Monitor (4 weeks, P1)
- **Total**: 4 features, 16 weeks

**EPIC v2.0 Section 7**:
- F-019: Transaction Security Scanner (34 points, 5 weeks, P0)
- F-020: Smart Contract Risk Scoring (21 points, 4 weeks, P0)
- F-021: Wallet Security Checker (13 points, 3 weeks, P1)
- F-022: Protocol Health Monitor (12 points, 4 weeks, P1)
- **Total**: 4 features, 80 points, 16 weeks

**User Stories v2.0 EPIC-5**:
- Feature 5.1: Smart Contract Audits (21 points, 4 stories)
- Feature 5.2: Wallet Screening (21 points, 4 stories)
- Feature 5.3: Risk Scoring (21 points, 4 stories)
- Feature 5.4: Security Alerts (17 points, 4 stories)
- **Total**: 4 features, 80 points, 16 stories

üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE**: User Stories features (5.1-5.4) do NOT match PRD features (F-019 to F-022)!

**User Stories has**:
- 5.1: Smart Contract Audits (audit platforms integration)
- 5.2: Wallet Screening (sanctions/blacklist screening)
- 5.3: Risk Scoring (protocol risk scoring)
- 5.4: Security Alerts (security feed integration)

**PRD has**:
- F-019: Transaction Security Scanner (pre-transaction scanning)
- F-020: Smart Contract Risk Scoring (contract risk scoring)
- F-021: Wallet Security Checker (wallet security health)
- F-022: Protocol Health Monitor (protocol health monitoring)

**Impact**: CRITICAL - User Stories are completely different features from PRD!

### 2.2 Architecture Review

**Technical Architecture v2.0** (Section 3.5):
- ‚úÖ Security Service defined
- ‚úÖ Components: Transaction Scanner, Contract Analyzer, Risk Scorer
- ‚úÖ Database tables: `security_scans`, `risk_scores`
- ‚úÖ API endpoints: `/v1/security/scan/*`, `/v1/security/risk-score/*`

**Alignment**: Architecture matches PRD features (Transaction Scanner, Contract Analyzer, Risk Scorer)

### 2.3 Tech Spec Review

**Tech Spec EPIC-5**:
- F5.1: Transaction Security Scanner (25 points, Week 1-3)
- F5.2: Smart Contract Auditor (25 points, Week 4-6)
- F5.3: Risk Scoring (15 points, Week 7-9)
- F5.4: Security Alerts (15 points, Week 10-12)
- **Total**: 4 features, 80 points, 12 weeks

**Issues**:
1. Feature IDs: F5.x instead of F-019 to F-022
2. Story points: 25+25+15+15 instead of 34+21+13+12
3. Timeline: 12 weeks instead of 16 weeks
4. Feature names: Partially match PRD but not exact

---

## 3. Issues Found (COMPLETE)

### Issue #1: üö® CRITICAL - User Stories Features Completely Different from PRD

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: User Stories implement wrong features!

**User Stories v2.0** has:
- Feature 5.1: Smart Contract Audits (audit platforms: CertiK, Immunefi, OpenZeppelin)
- Feature 5.2: Wallet Screening (sanctions/blacklist: Chainalysis, TRM Labs, Elliptic)
- Feature 5.3: Risk Scoring (protocol risk scoring)
- Feature 5.4: Security Alerts (security feeds: Forta, GoPlus, CertiK)

**PRD v2.0** requires:
- F-019: Transaction Security Scanner (pre-transaction scanning, malicious contract detection, phishing, honeypot)
- F-020: Smart Contract Risk Scoring (contract risk scoring, audit status, code analysis, team transparency)
- F-021: Wallet Security Checker (risky approvals, suspicious transactions, one-click revoke)
- F-022: Protocol Health Monitor (TVL monitoring, user activity, governance health, early warnings)

**Root Cause**: User Stories were written based on different requirements (audit platforms, wallet screening) instead of PRD requirements (transaction scanning, wallet security checker, protocol health monitor)

**Recommendation**: **REWRITE ALL 16 USER STORIES** to match PRD features F-019 to F-022

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours to rewrite all stories

---

### Issue #2: Tech Spec Feature IDs Mismatch

**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Confusing for development team

**Tech Spec** uses:
- F5.1, F5.2, F5.3, F5.4

**PRD/EPIC** uses:
- F-019, F-020, F-021, F-022

**Recommendation**: Update Tech Spec to use F-019 to F-022 naming

---

### Issue #3: Tech Spec Story Point Mismatch

**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Different story point distributions

**Tech Spec** shows:
- F5.1: 25 points
- F5.2: 25 points
- F5.3: 15 points
- F5.4: 15 points
- **Total**: 80 points

**EPIC v2.0** shows:
- F-019: 34 points
- F-020: 21 points
- F-021: 13 points
- F-022: 12 points
- **Total**: 80 points

**Recommendation**: Update Tech Spec to match EPIC v2.0 story points (34+21+13+12)

---

### Issue #4: Tech Spec Timeline Mismatch

**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Timeline discrepancy of 4 weeks

**Tech Spec** shows:
- F5.1: Week 1-3 (3 weeks)
- F5.2: Week 4-6 (3 weeks)
- F5.3: Week 7-9 (3 weeks)
- F5.4: Week 10-12 (3 weeks)
- **Total**: 12 weeks

**PRD/EPIC** shows:
- F-019: 5 weeks
- F-020: 4 weeks
- F-021: 3 weeks
- F-022: 4 weeks
- **Total**: 16 weeks

**Recommendation**: Update Tech Spec to match PRD/EPIC timeline (16 weeks)

---

### Issue #5: Tech Spec Feature Names Mismatch

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Feature names don't match PRD

**Tech Spec** uses:
- "Transaction Security Scanner" (F5.1) ‚úÖ MATCHES
- "Smart Contract Auditor" (F5.2) ‚ùå WRONG
- "Risk Scoring" (F5.3) ‚ùå WRONG
- "Security Alerts" (F5.4) ‚ùå WRONG

**PRD/EPIC** uses:
- "Transaction Security Scanner" (F-019) ‚úÖ
- "Smart Contract Risk Scoring" (F-020) ‚úÖ
- "Wallet Security Checker" (F-021) ‚úÖ
- "Protocol Health Monitor" (F-022) ‚úÖ

**Recommendation**: Update Tech Spec feature names to match PRD/EPIC
