   - Verify event generated and published to Redis pub/sub

3. **Receive Real-time Update** (Story 1.1 + 1.2)
   - Verify WebSocket client receives TVL change event
   - Verify event payload contains correct data
   - Verify latency <100ms end-to-end

4. **Create Alert Rule** (Story 1.3)
   - Create alert rule via REST API (e.g., "TVL > $1B")
   - Verify rule stored in PostgreSQL
   - Verify rule loaded into alert engine

5. **Trigger Alert** (Story 1.3)

### Scenario 3: Failover and Recovery Test

**Description:** Test system resilience to component failures.

**Steps:**
1. **Redis Failure** (Story 1.1 + 1.2 + 1.4)
   - Stop Redis container
   - Verify WebSocket connections gracefully degrade
   - Verify events queued in SQS
   - Restart Redis
   - Verify connections recover
   - Verify queued events processed

2. **PostgreSQL Failure** (Story 1.3 + 1.4)
   - Stop PostgreSQL container
   - Verify queries fail gracefully with error messages
   - Verify alert rules cached in memory
   - Restart PostgreSQL
   - Verify queries resume
   - Verify alert rules reloaded

3. **API Gateway Failure** (Story 1.1)
   - Simulate API Gateway failure
   - Verify clients reconnect automatically
   - Verify no data loss during reconnection

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Graceful degradation (no crashes)
- ✅ Automatic recovery within 60 seconds
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Clear error messages to clients

---

### Scenario 4: Security and Authorization Test

**Description:** Test authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Steps:**
1. **Invalid API Key** (Story 1.1)
   - Attempt WebSocket connection with invalid API key
   - Verify connection rejected with clear error message

2. **Unauthorized Access** (Story 1.3 + 1.4)
   - Attempt to create alert rule without authentication
   - Attempt to execute query without API key
   - Verify requests rejected with 401 Unauthorized

3. **Rate Limiting** (Story 1.4)
   - Execute queries exceeding rate limit
   - Verify requests throttled with 429 Too Many Requests

4. **SQL Injection** (Story 1.4)
   - Attempt SQL injection in query filters
   - Verify query sanitization prevents injection

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All unauthorized requests rejected
- ✅ Rate limiting enforced
- ✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities
