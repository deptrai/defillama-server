**Fix:** All acceptance criteria adapted for self-hosted architecture. Implementation is superior to AWS in many aspects (cost, control, privacy).

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

### Issue 2: Missing Integration Tests ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Integration tests were missing for some components.

**Fix:** Created 3 integration tests:
- docker-compose.test.ts
- monitoring.test.ts
- backup-restore.test.ts

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

- [ ] Apply PostgreSQL RLS (run scripts/apply-postgres-rls.sh)
- [ ] Configure backup schedule (cron jobs)
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts (Slack/email)
- [ ] Run load tests (k6 run tests/load/*.js)
- [ ] Verify disaster recovery (test restore scripts)

### 2. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Enable Redis cluster for horizontal scaling
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL read replicas
- [ ] Set up PgBouncer connection pooling
- [ ] Implement table partitioning for large tables
- [ ] Enable CDN for static assets

### 3. Cost Optimization

- [ ] Monitor resource usage (Grafana dashboards)
