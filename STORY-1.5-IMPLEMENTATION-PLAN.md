# Story 1.5: Infrastructure and Deployment - Implementation Plan

**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours  
**Total Lines:** ~4,530 lines (27 files)

---

## Executive Summary

### Story Overview
Implement production-ready infrastructure and deployment pipeline for DeFiLlama Real-time Analytics platform using Infrastructure as Code, comprehensive monitoring, and automated CI/CD.

### Current State vs Target State

**Current State:**
- ✅ Serverless Framework with basic CloudFormation resources
- ✅ Redis ElastiCache, WebSocket API, SQS queues configured
- ✅ Docker Compose for local development
- ✅ Basic CloudWatch alarms
- ❌ No VPC configuration
- ❌ No CI/CD pipeline
- ❌ Minimal monitoring dashboards
- ❌ No operational documentation

**Target State:**
- ✅ Complete VPC with public/private subnets
- ✅ Enhanced security with defense-in-depth
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring dashboards
- ✅ Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Operational runbooks and documentation
- ✅ Auto-scaling and cost optimization
- ✅ Backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Key Decision: Serverless Framework vs CDK

**Decision:** Use **Serverless Framework** (not CDK)

**Rationale:**
1. Already in use throughout the project
2. Less disruptive than migration to CDK
3. Meets all Story 1.5 requirements
4. Team familiarity and consistency
5. Faster implementation

**Trade-off:** Less type safety than CDK, but more maintainable for current team.
